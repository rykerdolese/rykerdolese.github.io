											<h3 class="major">QUANTFIN: An AI-Powered Backtesting and Portfolio Optimization Application</h3>
											<p>As part of the STAT 682 Quantitative Financial Analytics course, our group developed an end-to-end application to backtest trading strategies. The application supports training on data from 2014 to the present and benchmarking against traditional strategies like moving-average crossovers and momentum-based approaches. We implemented advanced techniques, including RNNs and Reinforcement Learning, to remain at the forefront of innovation. Additionally, we designed a dedicated feature to optimize portfolio allocation using an efficient frontier model.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Modeling Ebay Auctions</h3>
											<p>In this R-studio project, I analyzed bidder behavior and auction dynamics using visualizations, uncovering how auction length affects factors like opening bids and unique bidders. Through correlation analysis, I identified key predictors influencing selling prices. Ultimately, I used a LASSO Regression model to predict eBay auction prices for Palm Pilot M515 PDAs, navigating predictor interdependence for accurate estimations.</p>
