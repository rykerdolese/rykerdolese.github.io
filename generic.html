									<h3 class="major">My Story</h3>
									<p>I was born and raised in the vibrant city of New Orleans, Louisiana, where the rich culture and diverse influences of the Big Easy left an indelible mark on my life. As the son of two dedicated teachers, I was fortunate to grow up in a nurturing and academically enriching environment, which instilled in me the values of kindness and a strong work ethic. In my formative years, I was an avid athlete, playing both tennis and baseball. It was on the baseball field where I honed skills that would later serve me well in life â€“ teamwork, discipline, and a relentless commitment to improvement. In high school, I decided to focus solely on baseball, dedicating countless hours to perfecting my game.<p>

<p>My pursuit of excellence led me to Rice University, a place that, like my parents, values academics and the pursuit of knowledge. What drew me to Rice, however, was not only its academic reputation but also its unique culture, one that fosters inclusivity and celebrates diversity. This environment challenged me to broaden my horizons, both academically and personally, and helped shape me into a well-rounded individual. I am now setting my sights on a career in the financial sector, where I aim to apply my analytical skills, discipline, and commitment to teamwork to make a meaningful impact.<p>

<p>My life journey, from the lively streets of New Orleans to the hallowed halls of Rice University, has been a testament to the values instilled in me by my parents and the lessons learned on the baseball field. With a deep-seated passion for finance and a commitment to making a difference, I am eager to embark on the next chapter of my life, ready to face new challenges and opportunities with the same dedication and enthusiasm that have defined me so far. </p>
