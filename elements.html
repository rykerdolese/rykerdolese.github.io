															<p>As a Business Intelligence Analyst at Fidelity Bank LA, I was responsible for spearheading the development of an executive dashboard in Power BI. This dashboard provided a comprehensive overview of loans, direct deposits, CDs, fees, and mortgages, allowing the senior executives to make informed and strategic decisions based on the presented insights.

Being the sole contributor to this initiative, I had the privilege of personally delivering these findings to the top-level executives, earning special recognition from both the CEO and COO for the instrumental role the dashboard played in shaping strategic actions.

Leveraging dynamic ad-hoc reports on customer interactions and teller transactions, I played a vital role in driving top-level decisions to reallocate employees and provide targeted training for improved efficiency. As a result of these efforts, customer satisfaction scores saw an impressive 5-30% increase across various branches.

Additionally, my expertise in implementing automation solutions, utilizing Azure SQL Databases, Salesforce, VisualCron, and nCino, proved invaluable in extracting, cleaning, and visualizing data for Commercial and Small Business SVPs, enhancing the effectiveness of their decision-making process.

My dedication to data accuracy and validation ensured that reports and dashboards were reliable, instilling a sense of trust and confidence in the data-driven insights provided. Throughout my tenure at Fidelity Bank, I consistently pursued excellence in business intelligence, actively monitoring industry trends and emerging technologies to remain at the forefront of analytics excellence.

My time at Fidelity Bank was both enriching and fulfilling, and I take immense pride in the impact I made during my role as a Business Intelligence Analyst.</p>

																<p>I collaborated closely with a team of over 40 undergraduates to produce comprehensive scouting reports for Rice University's basketball and baseball teams. Our collective efforts resulted in a remarkable increase in the teams' win percentage by more than 20%. Throughout this project, I played a key role in developing a highly efficient web scraper using Python. This automation streamlined the scouting report process, successfully summarizing the data in easy-to-understand spreadsheets. By condensing the information into concise and organized formats, our reports became readily accessible and comprehensible for coaches. This enabled them to quickly grasp the key insights and make informed decisions to enhance team performance.</p>

				As a Research Intern at Access Health Louisiana in New Orleans, LA, from May '21 to March '22, I actively contributed to various aspects of the organization's HIV prevention and engagement efforts. In collaboration with a team of four other members, I participated in a weekly journal club focused on analyzing different HIV prevention methods. Through thorough analysis, we identified pre-exposure prophylaxis as the most effective method, with nearly 100% efficiency.

Additionally, I played a key role in gathering and analyzing patient data to ensure optimal follow-up and engagement with the clinic. As a result of our efforts, over 95% of patients remained in care during my internship, highlighting the success of our strategies.

Moreover, I took the lead in developing and implementing successful HIV outreach initiatives at public events such as "Parasols for Life" and various New Orleans Festivals. These initiatives aimed to raise awareness and promote HIV prevention measures within the community.

Lastly, I utilized my skills in creating engaging PowerPoint presentations to effectively communicate departmental research findings to a broader audience. By presenting the research in a visually compelling manner, we were able to disseminate valuable information and insights to a wider group of stakeholders.</p>
